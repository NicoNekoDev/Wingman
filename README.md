# Wingman

Failed project of mine that didn't see the light of the day.
The idea of the project was to create a plugin for temporary fly that was
a better alternative to non-working ones.
However I didn't really had time at that moment to work on it.
Now it exists as a plugin called "TempFly" which have everything you need.

So, in other words, I'm no longer maintaining/working on this project.
